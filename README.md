# REAL_TIME_CHAT_APPLICATION

 This is real time chat app made with react.js and socket.io. 
 
 To build the backend I used Node.js. 
 
 Socket.io is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.

 
 Note:- to run this in your system use the command
 
 npm run start

 *Features of this app:-*
 1) Users can send messages to one another in real time.
 2) An auto-scroll feature is present which will happen on receiving new messages.
 3) Not only can the user see the messages that he received from another user but also the ones he sent.
 4) Only users that have joined the same room will be able to chat. 


There are no cross-origin-resource-sharing(CORS) issues in this code and all that has been taken care of.
